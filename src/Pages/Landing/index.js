            There are many different global social issues in the world such as
            racism, gender inequality, poverty and many more. Our mission is to
            spread awareness about these social issues in the world which are
            displayed in different traits implemented in our Kitsune NFTs. Our
            goal is to donate a percentage of the sales to a few different
            non-profit organizations that support solving these global social
            issues.
